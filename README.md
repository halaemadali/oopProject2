## Project Overview

A desktop Hotel Reservation System built in Java using JavaFX, applying core Object-Oriented Programming principles and software design concepts.

- **Milestone 1** focused on the complete backend implementation and OOP architecture.
- **Milestone 2** introduced the graphical user interface (GUI), database integration using full system interaction through JavaFX.

The system supports hotel reservation management for guests, receptionists, and administrators through separate dashboards and functionalities.

## OOP Concepts Used

- **Inheritance** — Admin and Receptionist extend Staff
- **Abstraction** — Staff is an abstract class
- **Encapsulation** — all fields are private with getters/setters
- **Polymorphism** — Staff methods overridden in subclasses
- **Interfaces** — Manageable and Payable define contracts
- **Custom Exceptions** — meaningful error handling throughout
